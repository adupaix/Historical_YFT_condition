# Run

The scripts run with [R version 4.0.3](https://www.r-project.org/) (R Core Team, 2020).

The [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/) environment to run the model is provided. To create, type : `conda env create -f r-tuna-condition.yml`

Templates of the config files are provided: `cfg/job_template.pbs` (to run the bootstrap on a cluster) and `cfg/cfg_template.R`. Config files used to obtain the results of the study are available in `cfg/paper_cfgs.zip`.

Outputs obtained with `.pbs` files are then used to run `main_post_cluster.R`

# Data availability

Data used in the study is available in Guillou et al. (2021).
